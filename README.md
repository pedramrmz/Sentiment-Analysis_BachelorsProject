# Sentiment Analysis in Social Media  

## Project Description  
This project focuses on sentiment analysis in social media using neural networks. The main model combines CNN and LSTM, achieving **91% accuracy**.  

## Features  
âœ… Preprocessing steps: Persian text normalization, emoji removal, Arabic-to-Persian character conversion, noise and stopword removal  
âœ… Sentiment classification using LSTM and CNN models  
âœ… Data augmentation by replacing positive words with synonyms to improve accuracy  
âœ… Executed on Google Colab with a **T4 GPU**  

## Results & Analysis  
The model achieved **91% accuracy**, and results showed that the CNN-LSTM combination outperformed simpler models.  

## Future Improvements  
ðŸ”¹ Experiment with alternative models for better accuracy and overfitting prevention  
ðŸ”¹ Optimize preprocessing to reduce noise in data  
ðŸ”¹ Implement an API for real-time sentiment analysis
